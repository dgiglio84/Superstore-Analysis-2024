**Conclusion**

- With a significant net loss, removing the Cubify CubeX 3D Printer from the store's catalog would likely make a large impact on their overall profit.
- By taking a closer look at the negative profits in the Central region, we can determine that the biggest loss is in the furniture category:

- The ship time directly correlates with the annual profit. Specifically, as ship times decreased, the profits grow higher.
- The steady decrease in discounts from 2011 to 2013 may have had an impact on the 44 customers the store lost in 2014.
-	By contacting the list of customers who left in 2014, we can gain more insight into their departure.
